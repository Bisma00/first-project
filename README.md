# Simple Frontend Project 

This is one of my practice projects where I explored **CSS styling** and learned how to **organize JavaScript/React components**.  

## What I Learned
- How to style pages using **basic CSS** (colors, spacing, fonts, image handling).  
- How to **locate and organize React components** in a project.  
- How HTML, CSS, and JS work together to build a functional page.  

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3 (basic styling)**  
- **React (basic components & JSX)**
